# Project MagNET 

An Open Source data sync app and distributed server for iot data.  Intended to provide a place to primarily capture data.  A follow on release will provide a new Open version of IoToneKit, simply letting the user or companies define UX for IoT devices via profile "kits". 

This goal is to make it possible to avoid using proprietary clouds or services, and let the user control how IoT data is used, and control the security. An open server stack will ensure an easy way to capture data locally or in the cloud.
