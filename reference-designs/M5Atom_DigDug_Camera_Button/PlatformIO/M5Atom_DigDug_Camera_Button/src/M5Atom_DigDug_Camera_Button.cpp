  Mag*NET Button is an M5Stack ESP32 based button.
  It should be configurable to act as a button for anything.  Our example will be used
  to implement the standard servcies.  Ideally this button can fire a camera shutter or
  do something like activate a microphone.

  ## Design Goals

  On a phone, the UI generated is a traditional button in the style of a stateful widget.
  In stealing a concept from social media, we follow specific things.  And we like (true)
  certain things.  So devices could like each other, forming a relationship, and then a
  camera shutter could subscribe to a button press.  No technical terms.  

  In spacial AR, this button could be linked to a camera shutter via a visual interface.
  Drag and drop an arrow between them.

  In a pure machine terms, an AI could orchestrate this relationship without human
  intervention.  Ideally though, there is something like OAuth (but not Oauth) in terms
  of letting a user intervene in approving relationships between devices.

  This only covers a BLE use case.

  ## Background on physical buttons

  The originator of a button that does something when pressed is probably a few hundred
  years ago.  The notion of wearing buttons probably showed up commonly in Star Wars.
  Surprisingly nobody has made a wearable button trigger a commonplace thing.  Due to 
  latency of voice capture / wakeword / ai along with energy cost, it makes sense to have
  a human push a button to trigger something.

  Based on DigDug BLE PoC 3

  Goal of PoC 3 is to wire an external button that will easily be used as a wearable
  and get this to advertise as

  XevIOT_Poc3

  Any button presses update tte characteristic

  Blink + BLE Example

``BLE Example: https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO-BLE-Sense-Bluetooth-Usage/

  Turns an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

  Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the UNO, MEGA and ZERO
  it is attached to digital pin 13, on MKR1000 on pin 6. LED_BUILTIN is set to
  the correct LED pin independent of which board is used.
  If you want to know what pin the on-board LED is connected to on your Arduino
  model, check the Technical Specs of your board at:
